          In the following, we like to present our results from the COIN Coolhunting Project "Bodyhacking". The project was realized by multiple teams from Germany and Switzerland.

        <p class="section-description lead">
          We decided to split the topic "Bodyhacking" into three different parts with unique aspects:

          <b>Cyborgs</b> (<b>Cyb</b>ernetic <b>Org</b>anism) are a deep symbiosis of biology and technology. As the terms says, they are partially cybernetic as well as partially organic. Cyborgs are humans that extend their physical and mental capabilities with the help of technology. Especially the extended sensory perception is an interesting point. The cybernetic extension can be implanted, but doesn't have to. It can be also achieved by the intense utilisation of external devices. Besides that, some Cyborgs also have the purpose to extend their life time using technology.

          <b>Eternal Life</b> describes the strive for immortality. With today's technology and level of knowledge there are already possibilities to prolong human life significantly (e.g. by exchanging old with new blood) or even indefinitely (<a href="#eternal-life">studies by Pearson, Kurzweil and Aubrey de Grey</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          The term <b>Singularity</b> is used to denominate the point in time from which machines and algorithms can rapidly improve themselves using artificial intelligence (AI). This would accelerate technological progress exponentially, making the future of mankind beyond this point unpredictable. Some exponents of the field assume that the associated technological leaps will significantly prolong the human lifespan or even lead to biological immortality. It could also become possible to separate human consciousness from its biological carrier and port it into a completely artificial shell.

          For each of the three categories, Coolhuntings have been conducted with Condor in order to find related terms for the respective category, which could then be used for further investigations.

          The terms were then analyzed using Google Trends to measure their strength and popularity against each other and find the most relevant ones. For the category of Cyborg, the strongest term was – not surprisingly – <i>Cyborg</i>:

          The findings acquired were used to find the one strongest trend within the <b>Bodyhacking</b> subject as a whole. Each respectively strongest term from the three categories was compared against the others. In order to prevent similar terms with divergent semantics or unrelated subjects distorting the results, "subjects" were selected instead of search terms. This also makes sure that results from different languages are also included.

          Globally, <i>Immortality (Eternal Life)</i> appears to be the most relevant category with a popularity of 40%, followed by <i>Cyborg</i> with 30% popularity, with <i>Singularity's</i> 24% being a close third but still clearly behind the other concepts. Looking at results just from Germany, <i>Immortality</i> takes up half of all <i>Bodyhacking</i>-related queries, with <i>Cyborg</i> and <i>Eternal Life</i> tied at 25% each.

                Though magnetic implants can be used to pick up small metal objects, the main purpose of getting an implant is in order to gain sensory perception of magnetic fields. After a magnet is implanted underneath the epidermal layer of the skin, nerves grow around the magnet as the skin heals. The magnet pushes against magnetic fields produced by electronic devices in the surrounding area, pushing against the nerves and giving a "sixth sense" of magnetic vision.

        <p class="section-description lead">
          Since the early developments of technology, people were fascinated about Cyborgs. Already in 1818 a Roman named “Frankenstein” was released and described the basic structures of a modern Cyborg. Today we have reached an age where the human race has the abilities to create some sort of Cyborgs for real. So we tried to answer the Question: “What will Cyborgs look like in 50 Years?” to determine the progress of Transhumanism the human race made.

          Starting with a Condor-assisted Coolhunt for the cyborgs with the highest betweenness centrality (fig. 1), the results could then be processed with Google Trends, showing the most popular of the resulting cyborgs over the last five years. The same procedure could also be utilized to identify a list of the most popular cyborgs of the last twelve months.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          The shifting results over time show that the public's perception of cyborgs has changed in that it pays more attention to the "artistic cyborgs". For example, Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas have gained popularity (fig. 2, fig. 3, fig. 4, fig. 5), while the public's interest in Tim Cannon and Kevin Warwick has diminished slightly. Solely Hugh Herr (possessing performance-enhancing prosthesis) has gained popularity over the last five years despite being a "non-artistic" cyborg.

          The Wikipedia dataset can be viewed as the neutral basis since it contains neither the websites of cyborgs nor those of scientists involved. Comparing this to the data collected on the free web shows that the scientific approach is viewed more positively there – the words <i>science</i>, <i>scientist</i> or <i>studies</i> are not listed as negatives like on Wikipedia, but instead have a positive connotation or are missing altogether. The web seems to have a more positive understanding of the scientific method.

        <p class="section-description lead">
          Looking at the area of body modifications shows a rather neutral to negative view of the overall picture on Wikipedia. In comparison, the subject’s <i>implants</i>, <i>computers</i> and <i>machines</i> are decidedly negative in the eyes of the web and Wikipedia. Instead, positively-connotated words from the web are <i>life</i>, <i>mind</i> and <i>organism</i>. It seems that from a scientific point of view, the insertion of individual implants is less interesting than the occupation with prolongation of human life and the prospect of mind uploading. Noticeable is the fact that the preoccupation with the human <i>brain</i> seems to be rather negatively-viewed on both platforms, despite the related concepts of <i>idea</i> and <i>mind</i> being positive. The reason for this is the frequent mention of the brain in negative contexts like "brain implant to recover lost memories" or "brain injuries". But there also appear to exit fears of brain-interfaces being able to take over a third party's brain and consequently its entire host body, or that the connection of the human brain to a machine would produce a matchless fighter and be misused for military purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          Since on the web, the words <i>work</i> as well as <i>years</i> are viewed in a negative light, the assumption can be made that the subjects covered on the web are more difficult and time-consuming to realize.

        <p class="section-description lead">
          2050 is not that far. If you make it you have a chance to live forever. A bold statement, made by a group of coolhunters from Germany and Switzerland. If you want to know how that is possible, you should keep reading.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          On our quest to find out the state of research and efforts towards human immortality, we were surprised to find out that the field - while not being entirely mainstream just yet - has become an area of viable scientific endeavor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously considered classifying aging as a disease. Doing so would open the door for anti-aging pills to be potentially officially recognized. While we're not just there yet, many companies and organizations have made it their goal to prolong the human lifespan, with ambitious goals varying from a few years, to a century, or even to complete immortality.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          Many tech-billionaires, driven by scientific interest and/or egoistic reasons, have either invested millions or even billions into companies conducting research into the field, or have even founded their own companies tasked with the same goal. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison doesn't understand the fact that dying is just accepted as an unavoidable fact of life and has invested more than $430 million into research companies. Google has founded Calico, a company trying to combine several scientific fields with the same goal.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          What are the expert's predictions on a timeframe when humanity might start to live forever? Of course being human, everyone is a bit biased on the subject. Nonetheless, the predictions might give us an idea of what could be possible. Aubrey de Grey, Chief Science Officer at Sens Research Foundation (SRF) which made immortality their mission statement, believes that there is a "50/50 chance" that he might see it happen within his lifetime. Being born in 1963, this could roughly be extrapolated to the 2060's. Another "futurist" with an outstanding track record of making mostly correct predictions - even though they might have sounded outlandish at the time - is Ray Kurzweil, who works at Google's as a leader in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. His prediction is that by the 2020's, humans will start using nanobots within their bodies to fight disease. With that technology, he believes immortality - or at least a prolongation of the human lifespan by several centuries - will be possible as early as 2029. Another prediction of his is the achievement of singularity by 2045 - the merging of a human mind and a non-biological carrier.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          While it might still sound like science fiction, based on the growing amount of resources and recognition gravitating towards the field of immortality research, we believe that - if it is at all possible - humanity might achieve this goal by the year 2050. And according to many futurists and researchers, we're actually playing it rather safe, compared to their ambitious goals!
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          There's only one question left, that seems to get a bit neglected: What happens to the planet once humanity gains immortality? Will the planet run out of resources? Will only the rich gain access to eternal life? Will it become illegal or highly regulated to procreate? It might be a highly exciting prospect to life forever, but it is certainly not without its troubles...

        <p class="section-description lead">
          The term Singularity is used to denominate the point in time from which machines and algorithms can rapidly improve themselves using artificial intelligence (AI). This would accelerate technological progress exponentially, making the future of mankind beyond this point unpredictable. Some exponents of the field assume that the associated technological leaps will significantly prolong the human lifespan or even lead to biological immortality. It could also become possible to separate human consciousness from ist biological carrier and port it into a completely artificial shell.

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Which part of the public has a positive view on Singularity?</h3>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          A comparison of the Condor-fetched data from the three types of sources – Experts (web sites), Swarm (Wikipedia) and Crowd (Twitter) - gives us the following insights, after using a sentiment analysis and graphically displaying the results in a word cloud:
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          Wikipedia's word cloud represents the neutral basis. The subject is described mainly without judgment or valuation. Twitter looks at the subject with a mostly positive outlook. Only the threat of technologically-caused unemployment seems to constitute a negative aspect.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          In the overall worldwide web, technological singularity is depicted in a mainly favorable fashion, although technology itself seems to bear a negative undertone due to the potential replacement of human workers, similar to the Twitter results. After Ray Kurzweil expressed a popular estimate of the point in time, at which singularity is likely to become reality, him and his statement also became popular targets for attack and counterstatements.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          While Twitter messages on the subject by enthusiastic fans are naturally only published in short statements, the web places a stronger focus on critical commentaries and opinions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-subtitle">How is the visibility of Singularity in the web increasing over time?</h3>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          To further illustrate the web's view on the subject, the search terms entered by German users are analyzed:

          <figcaption><p>Google Trends comparison of "Singularity" and "Cyborg"</p></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="section-description lead">
          Examining the progress of the number of searches for "singularity" and "cyborg" shows a trend towards a stronger interest in singularity, while the reference value for cyborg shows slightly decreased interest. The dotted trend lines clearly show these overall tendencies. Within the period under review from June 2012 to April 2017, the request frequency for singularity increased from an average of 34% within the first two months to an average of 41% over the last two months. This suggests that in Germany, singularity might be the dominating approach towards reaching immortality over the concept of turning into cyborgs, at least based on interest of the greater public.

          After collecting related websites on the subject with Condor web-fetcher, the accumulated data can be grouped in three categories: One part represents the opinion that singularity can be reached within a reasonable timeframe (i.e. within a lifetime), other pages represent the opposing view and believe such a thing can never happen, while a third fraction describes the subject in a neutral manner and doesn't take either side. The distribution is 45% pro, 32% against singularity becoming a reality, representing a tendency in favor of the yea-sayers. Looking at the average betweenness centrality of the sites per category reveals that both the pro and the contra sides have an influence of similar strength within the network.

              For this prediction, a Condor search for websites was conducted using the terms singularity, Singularität and HLMI (high-level machine intelligence). The resulting websites were then scanned for any specific predictions with a temporal estimate for the achievement of an adequate AI. Whenever an article contained several predictions, for example when containing a survey, the median was taken of points in time, about which the researches were 90% sure would mark the onset of singularity. The time at which the statements were made was also recorded.

            The chart visualizes the identified predictions: The blue graphs represents the projected year of reaching singularity, while the orange graph (with the scale on the right) shows the time difference between expressing the estimate and the estimated year. It shows that the predicted time remaining underwent constant changes. The technological capabilities necessary for achieving singularity seem to be evolving continuously, but also seemed to be perceived as developing slower than previously expected at around 2011. Within the last five years, the perceived speed of scientific advances seems to have recovered and the estimates started showing points in the future closer and closer to the present. The earliest mentioned date is 2027 and the trend suggests that even more optimistic predictions might be made in the near future.
