              <p>2050 is not that far. If you make it you have a chance to live forever. A bold statement, made by a group of coolhunters from Germany and Switzerland. If you want to know how that is possible, you should keep reading.</p>
              <p>
                On our quest to find out the state of research and efforts towards human immortality, we were surprised to find out that the field - while not being entirely mainstream just yet - has become an area of viable scientific endeavor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously considered classifying aging as a disease. Doing so would open the door for anti-aging pills to be potentially officially recognized. While we're not just there yet, many companies and organizations have made it their goal to prolong the human lifespan, with ambitious goals varying from a few years, to a century, or even to complete immortality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many tech-billionaires, driven by scientific interest and/or egoistic reasons, have either invested millions or even billions into companies conducting reaearch into the field, or have even founded their own companies tasked with the same goal. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison doesn't understand the fact that dying is just accepted as an unavoidable fact of life and has invested more than $430 million into research companies. Google has founded Calico, a company trying to combine several scientific fields with the same goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                What are the expert's predictions on a timeframe when humanity might start to live forever? Of course being human, everyone is a bit biased on the subject. Nonetheless, the predictions might give us an idea of what could be possible. Aubrey de Grey, Chief Science Officer at Sens Research Foundation (SRF) which made immortality their mission statement, believes that there is a "50/50 chance" that he might see it happen within his lifetime. Being born in 1963, this could roughly be extrapolated to the 2060's. Another "futurist" with an outstanding track record of making mostly correct predictions - even though they might have sounded outlandish at the time - is Ray Kurzweil, who works at Google's as a leader in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. His prediction is that by the 2020's, humans will start using nanobots within their bodies to fight disease. With that technology, he believes immortality - or at least a prolongation of the human lifespan by several centuries - will be possible as early as 2029. Another prediction of his is the achievement of singularity by 2045 - the merging of a human mind and a non-biological carrier.
              </p>
              <p>
                While it might still sound like science fiction, based on the growing amount of resources and recognition gravitating towards the field of immortality research, we belive that - if it is at all possible - humanity might achieve this goal by the year 2050. And according to many futurists and reasearches, we're actually playing it rather safe, compared to their ambitious goals!
              </p>
              <p>
                There's only one question left, that seems to get a bit neglected: What happens to the planet once humanity gains immortality? Will the planet run out of resources? Will only the rich gain access to eternal life? Will it become illegal or highly regulated to procreate? It might be a highly exciting prospect to life forever, but it is certainly not without its troubles...

              <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
              <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>

So, people will be able to say, I'm 30. This thing is going to go bad eventually. [...] Just chuck this one in the garbage and give me the good stuff. It's ambitious. It will take a long time and we want to do it open source with 3D printed parts and make it really low cost."

                    Though magnetic implants can be used to pick up small metal objects, the main purpose of getting an implant is in order to gain sensory perception of magnetic fields. After a magnet is implanted underneath the epidermal layer of the skin, nerves grow around the magnet as the skin heals. The magnet pushes against magnetic fields produced by electronic devices in the surrounding area, pushing against the nerves and giving a "sixth sense" of magnetic vision.
